This project examines two key areas within England: housing market trends and biodiversity patterns.

The first part gives insights to answer the question: How have residential property sales volumes evolved across England’s districts from 2000 to 2023, and which regions have shown the highest transaction activity? To annswer, block 1 uses England'a Residential property sales database (NOMIS, 2024). The code, written in Python, performs data cleaning, filtering, and transformation to generate summary statistics and meaningful visualisations. These include identifying peak property sales years by district, total national yearly sales, and the top 20 districts with the highest overall transaction volumes. These outputs are intended to inform business stakeholders and housing market analysts by offering insights into long-term trends and regional demand patterns.

The second part of the project addresses the question: What is the spatial distribution of bat species observations across England in 2024, and how do these records compare inside versus outside National Parks? Bat species are a conservation priority, with many classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2023). This section uses Chiroptera records from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) alongside geospatial boundary data for National Parks and regional divisions. Spatial join techniques are applied to assess the concentration of bat records within and outside protected areas. The analysis is intended for policymakers, who may use the findings to guide conservation priorities, and for the public, to raise awareness of national biodiversity patterns.

The GitHub repository contains all core datasets used in the analysis except for the NBN dataset, which exceeds GitHub’s 25MB upload limit. Included files are: Eng_sales_1995_2025_Exp.csv (housing sales), National_Parks_(England)___Natural_England.shp (national park boundaries), and GOR_England.gpkg (generalised regional boundaries). The repository also includes an Images directory containing bat illustrations to enhance the final spatial visualisation, making the map more dynamic. Users should obtain the NBN Chiroptera dataset directly from the NBN Atlas and add it to their local working directory to enable full reproduction of the geospatial analysis.

To reproduce this analysis, users need Python (or Google Colab) and the libraries pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and shapely. The code is structured into two parts: Block 1 covers housing sales, while Block 2 focuses on bat observations. With the required datasets, the results can be easily recreated.
