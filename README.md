This project first examines housing market trends in England by analysing residential property sales data from 2000 to 2023. The GitHub repository includes the raw dataset sourced from NOMIS, which covers the number of residential property sales in each district from 1995 to 2023. The aim of the analysis is to identify the years and districts with the highest volume of house sales across England. The accompanying code is designed to clean and process the data, generate a new variable representing the total number of sales in England per year, and produce non-spatial visualisations, including Top 20 Districts with the Highest Number of Sales (2000–2023) and Total Property Sales in England (2000–2023). This information is intended to benefit business stakeholders in the real estate industry by providing insights into market trends and regional demand.

The second part of the project focuses on biodiversity, with an emphasis on the spatial distribution of bats (order Chiroptera) across England. The repository includes species observation data from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN), based on 2024 records, integrated with spatial boundary datasets for national parks and regional divisions sourced from data.gov.uk. The analysis involves data cleaning and the use of spatial join techniques to identify which national parks and regions contain the highest number of Chiroptera records. Bats are among the most threatened mammalian groups in the UK, with several species listed as vulnerable or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2023). This analysis aims to support conservation efforts by highlighting biodiversity hotspots and informing future monitoring and protection strategies within England’s protected areas — making the results especially relevant for the public and policymakers concerned with environmental planning and wildlife conservation.
