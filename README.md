This project investigates two key areas related to England: housing market trends and biodiversity patterns, with a particular focus on the distribution of bat species (Chiroptera). The first part of the analysis examines residential property sales data between 2000 and 2023, using data sourced from the NOMIS database. The code, written in Python, performs data cleaning, filtering, and transformation to enable summary statistics and meaningful visualisations. These include the identification of peak property sales years across districts, total national sales per year, and the top 20 districts with the highest overall transaction volumes. These outputs are intended to inform business stakeholders and housing market analysts by offering insights into long-term trends and regional demand patterns.

The second part of the project focuses on biodiversity conservation, specifically the spatial distribution of bat observations across England in 2024. Bat species are a priority group, with many listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2023). This section uses Chiroptera records from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) and combines them with geospatial boundary data for national parks and regional divisions. Spatial join techniques are used to identify areas where bat records are most concentrated, helping inform environmental researchers and policymakers about biodiversity hotspots and priority zones for monitoring and protection.

The GitHub repository contains all core datasets used in the analysis, including: Eng_sales_1995_2025_Exp.csv (housing sales), National_Parks.gjson (national park boundaries), and GOR_England.gpkg (generalised regional boundaries). The repository also includes a shapefile folder (National_Parks_England_...) and an Images directory to store exported figures. The NBN Chiroptera dataset is not included in the GitHub repository because its file size exceeds the 25MB upload limit. Users should obtain this dataset directly from the NBN Atlas and add it to their local working directory.

To reproduce this analysis, users will need to have Python installed along with libraries such as pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and shapely. All code is provided in a modular and clearly annotated format, split into two thematic blocks. Once all required datasets are in place, the code can be executed sequentially to recreate the results shown in the project.
